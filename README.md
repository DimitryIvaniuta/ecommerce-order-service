##Cloud SQL Auth Proxy with Docker (PostgreSQL)
#Project Overview

This setup demonstrates how to run the Google Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in a Docker container to connect securely to a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance. By using the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, your connections to the database are authorized via IAM and encrypted, eliminating the need for IP whitelisting or managing SSL certificates​

. The result is a secure local proxy service that you can connect your psql client or applications (like Spring Boot) to, as if the database were running locally.

#Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*    Google Cloud Project with a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance created (and the Cloud SQL Admin API enabled).
    Service Account with the Cloud SQL Admin role and Cloud SQL Instance User role. This service account will be used by the proxy to authenticate to your Cloud SQL instance (the Instance User role allows logging into the database​
    serverfault.com
    ).
*   Service Account Key: A JSON key file for the above service account (downloaded as service_account.json). Keep this file safe.
*    Docker installed on your local machine (Docker Engine or Docker Desktop).
*    (Optional) gcloud CLI installed and authenticated, if you plan to use Cloud SQL IAM database authentication.

# Steps to Set Up Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in Docker 
1. Place the Service Account JSON Securely

Choose a secure location on your local machine for the service_account.json file. For example, you might create a directory outside of your application code (to avoid committing it to source control). Place the downloaded JSON key file there. You will mount this file into the Docker container so the proxy can use it for authentication.
